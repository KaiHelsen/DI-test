funny.derpso let's see if this works
is it doing newline?

test

test again
test again and again

so I think this works, look, polymorphism isn't something that's new to me.
I've been using polymorphism and classes for a long time now. the only thing that's relatively new to me is interfaces, and I think I understand how those work well enough. Only thing about interfaces is that I'm not very experienced in using them, so I tend to default to classes and abstract classes and the like.
